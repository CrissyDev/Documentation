                        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to controll a broeser and its Document Object Model(DOM).For example client-side extentions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form inputs and page navigation</li>
                        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.For example, server-side extentions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information fromone invocation to another of the file application, or perform file manipulation on a server. </li>
